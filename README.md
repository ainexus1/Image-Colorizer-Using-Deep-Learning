# Image Colorizer

## Overview

This project is an image colorizer implemented using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the help of Keras. The model takes grayscale images as input and predicts the corresponding colored versions.

## Features

- Utilizes a CNN architecture for image colorization.
- Training data is obtained from the kaggle website

## How to Use

1. **Dataset Download:**
   - Download the dataset from the kaggle website

2. **Training:**
   - Train the model using the provided training script.

3. **Colorizing Images:**
   - Load a grayscale image you want to colorize using the trained model.

4. **Results:**
   - View the colorized image generated by the model.

## Model Architecture

The implemented CNN architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, upsampling layers for image upscaling, and utilizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss for optimization.
